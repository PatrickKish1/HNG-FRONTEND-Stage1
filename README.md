## 🎯 About This Project

This portfolio is more than just a webpage; it's a canvas where I paint my skills and dreams. It’s built from scratch by a beginner (that’s me!) and showcases my projects, skills, and everything in between that I've learned on my journey so far.

### 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML**: The skeleton that holds the body of my pages.
- **CSS**: The artist that styles and breathes life into my design.
- **JavaScript**: The puppeteer that adds interaction and makes the magic happen.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to see how a beginner turned coffee into code? Here’s how you can get a local copy up and running:

### Prerequisites

- A sense of adventure
- A sprinkle of curiosity
- A dash of patience



## 🔍 Features
- **Interactive Elements:** Watch out for buttons and links that actually work! Thanks to JavaScript, these elements respond to your clicks and hover effects.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with mobile in mind, this site adjusts neatly to fit different screen sizes, making it accessible on various devices.
- **Aesthetic Appeal:** With a keen eye on design trends, I've employed a minimalist approach that's both attractive and functional.

## 🌟 What I Learned
Building this portfolio taught me not just about coding, but about problem-solving, Googling like a pro, and the importance of persistence. Every error was a lesson and every bug a teacher!
