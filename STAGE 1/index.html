            <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
            <p>As a budding web developer with immense potential for growth, I aim to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a solid foundation in web development. My journey includes learning a JavaScript framework like React.js or Vue.js to create dynamic applications. Understanding version control with Git and GitHub is crucial for collaboration and project management. I plan to build a personal portfolio to showcase my skills and projects, which will be pivotal in landing a job. Exploring backend development with Node.js and Express.js, along with gaining proficiency in both SQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, will round out my full-stack development capabilities. Contributing to open-source projects will enhance my learning and community engagement. Focusing on responsive design ensures my projects are mobile-friendly and adaptable to various screen sizes. Additionally, learning about web performance optimization will help me create fast-loading, efficient websites. My overarching goal is to work on amazing projects with talented individuals, ultimately leading to securing a job in the tech industry. Staying updated with the latest trends and technologies is a continuous process that will drive my career forward.</p>
